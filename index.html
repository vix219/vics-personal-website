        <p> My name is Victoria Lima De Carvalho, and I am person of many interests. 
            I've recently added software engineering to my repertoire. I'm a native of Amazonas, Brazil,
        though I've been in the USA for 25 years. I consider myself a person commited to creating community in any space I'm part of, this is extremely important to me. 
    My current focus is learning as much as I can, in order to progress in the field of software engineering. For me, challanges are enjoyable,
and the sense of accomplishment when I am able to problem solve is what drives me. </p>
